        <h3>Why I love Roblox</h3>
       
        <p> I love roblox very much. I play it for so long eveyrday everyday of my life since I was 6yrs old. I love it because it is so fun to play with friends. You can literally play any game possible that you've ever dreamed of. It is so entertaining to play and better than any other game because it has those games in roblox. You can also costumize your own avatar any way you want. You can do that by buying robux which you can use for many other things in game as well. </p>
